# Basic PiRadio

## Circuit

This radio uses a simple circuit of 4 leds and two buttons to function. A diagram of how the buttons and leds are connected can be found in the repo. Any GPIO pins should work as long as they are set correctly in the main.py script.
## Requirements
This script requires VLC and VLC-python. Install the latter with
`
pip install python-vlc
`

## Channels
Setup channels and corresponding leds in the CHANNELS array. Radio channels can be easily found by going to an internet stream and checking the stream url in your browser network console.
